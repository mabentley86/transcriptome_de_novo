# Transcriptome de novo  
A pipeline for de novo transcriptome construction and analysis.

## Sortmerna  

## Trinity
Trinity, developed at the Broad Institute and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, represents a novel method for the efficient and robust de novo reconstruction of transcriptomes from RNA-seq data. Manual found [here](https://github.com/trinityrnaseq/trinityrnaseq/wiki).

## Trinotate
Trinotate is a comprehensive annotation suite designed for automatic functional annotation of transcriptomes, particularly de novo assembled transcriptomes, from model or non-model organisms. Manual found [here](https://trinotate.github.io/).

## DIAMOND [(Manual)](https://github.com/bbuchfink/diamond) 
DIAMOND is a sequence aligner for protein and translated DNA searches and functions as a drop-in replacement for the NCBI BLAST software tools. It is suitable for protein-protein search as well as DNA-protein search on short reads and longer sequences including contigs and assemblies, providing a speedup of BLAST ranging up to x20,000.
